Homework Blog for ICM Week2

Had a little fun coding, from last class I realized I needed to add comments to code. I think I enjoyed not commenting my code, but alas comments and spelling errors return.
I relized i miss tab complete because of spelling. I played with sound calls I found from openAI. I spent too much time on that and not enough of the idea of the project. THough there was a clear relainship between draw calls and tone when they can overlap inside a draw function
